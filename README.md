# CS771---Cracking-the-ML-PUF

This project focuses on breaking a multi-level PUF by simplifying its structure mathematically and applying machine learning models with hyperparameter tuning for optimal speed and accuracy.  
It also includes delay recovery from an Arbiter PUF.  
See the [original problem statement](https://example.com/problem-statement) for more details.
